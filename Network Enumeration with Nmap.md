Enumeration is the most critical part of all. The art, the difficulty, and the goal are not to gain access to our target computer. 
Instead, it is identifying all of the ways we could attack a target we must find.


Network Mapper (Nmap) is an open-source network analysis and security auditing tool written in C, C++, Python, and Lua. It is designed to scan networks and identify which hosts are available on the network using raw packets, and services and applications, including the name and version, where possible. It can also identify the operating systems and versions of these hosts. Besides other features, Nmap also offers scanning capabilities that can determine if packet filters, firewalls, or intrusion detection systems (IDS) are configured as needed.

Use Cases
The tool is one of the most used tools by network administrators and IT security specialists. It is used to:

    Audit the security aspects of networks
    Simulate penetration tests
    Check firewall and IDS settings and configurations
    Types of possible connections
    Network mapping
    Response analysis
    Identify open ports
    Vulnerability assessment as well.
