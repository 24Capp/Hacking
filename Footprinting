The whole enumeration process is divided into three different levels:
Infrastructure-based enumeration 	Host-based enumeration 	OS-based enumeration

These layers are designed as follows:
Layer 	Description 	Information Categories
1. Internet Presence 	Identification of internet presence and externally accessible infrastructure. 	Domains, Subdomains, vHosts, ASN, Netblocks, IP Addresses, Cloud Instances, Security Measures
2. Gateway 	Identify the possible security measures to protect the company's external and internal infrastructure. 	Firewalls, DMZ, IPS/IDS, EDR, Proxies, NAC, Network Segmentation, VPN, Cloudflare
3. Accessible Services 	Identify accessible interfaces and services that are hosted externally or internally. 	Service Type, Functionality, Configuration, Port, Version, Interface
4. Processes 	Identify the internal processes, sources, and destinations associated with the services. 	PID, Processed Data, Tasks, Source, Destination
5. Privileges 	Identification of the internal permissions and privileges to the accessible services. 	Groups, Users, Permissions, Restrictions, Environment
6. OS Setup 	Identification of the internal components and systems setup. 	OS Type, Patch Level, Network config, OS Environment, Configuration files, sensitive private files

Important note: The human aspect and the information that can be obtained by employees using OSINT have been removed from the "Internet Presence" layer for simplicity.
